# bitmeteros-python-client

Desktop Client for [BitMeter OS](https://github.com/codebox/bitmeteros) (experimental, only works with v0.7.x of BitMeter OS)

This client provides a floating graph window on the desktop, displaying data captured by BitMeter OS. It is in the early stages of development, and will certainly contain bugs. You must install BitMeter OS before using this client, it won't work on its own. You will also need to have Python, and the wxPython libraries, installed on your system - most Linux and OSX systems should have these already, Windows users can download them from here: [Windows Python installer](http://www.python.org/download/releases/), [wxPython libraries](http://www.wxpython.org/download.php).

The source code for this utility should provide a useful reference for for anyone wishing to develop other BitMeter OS clients - Python code is quite easy to understand even if you haven't used the language before.
